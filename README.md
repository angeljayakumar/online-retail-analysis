# üõçÔ∏è Online Retail Customer Behaviour Analysis

This project analyzes customer behavior using a retail transaction dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishekrp1517/online-retail-transactions-dataset). It includes data cleaning (ETL), descriptive statistics, and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to understand purchasing patterns.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `etl_cleaning.ipynb`: Extract, clean, and transform the dataset.
- `customer_behaviour.ipynb`: Analyze customer behavior and segment customers.
- `sales_trends.ipynb`: Analyze sales patterns over time (planned).
- `product_trends.ipynb`: Identify top-selling products (planned).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Date Column Handling

### Issue 1: `InvoiceDate` Becomes `object` When Reloaded

- During the ETL process, `InvoiceDate` was correctly converted to `datetime`.
- However, when saved to CSV and reloaded in another notebook, it appeared as `object` (string).
- This happened because CSV files store dates as plain text.

### ‚úÖ Solution

Use the `parse_dates` parameter when reading the CSV:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('cleaned_data.csv', parse_dates=['InvoiceDate'])



### Issue 2: DtypeWarning Due to Mixed Types in Invoice Column

When loading the dataset with pd.read_csv, a warning appeared:


DtypeWarning: Columns (0) have mixed types. Specify dtype option on import or set low_memory=False.
This means the Invoice column (column 0) contains mixed data types, which can cause problems during analysis.

‚úÖ Solution
Based on Kaggle data review, convert the Invoice column explicitly to numeric:

df['Invoice'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Invoice'], errors='coerce').astype('Int64')


Convert the InvoiceDate column to datetime:


df['InvoiceDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['InvoiceDate'])
This ensures consistent types for analysis and avoids the warning.

üîß Pending Fixes for Other Object Columns
The following columns remain as object and need review/conversion:

StockCode

ProductName

Country

Weekday

These will be addressed in future updates.



## Future Work

- Implement interactive visualization for identifying high-value, low-frequency customers using Plotly or another suitable tool to enhance insight into customer segments.



- (Additional enhancements to be added here for future delivery.)
