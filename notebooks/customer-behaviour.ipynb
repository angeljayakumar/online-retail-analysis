    "## Customer Behaviour Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis focuses on understanding customer purchasing behaviour to gain insights into customer engagement, loyalty, and value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Will Explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "- **Total Sales**: Overall revenue generated.\n",
    "- **Average Transaction Value**: Average spend per transaction.\n",
    "- **Unique Customers**: Number of distinct customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Customer Behaviour Metrics (RFM Analysis)\n",
    "- **Recency**: Days since last purchase.\n",
    "- **Frequency**: Number of purchases.\n",
    "- **Monetary**: Total spending.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the data distribution and patterns, we will use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matplotlib**: For basic histograms showing the distribution of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.\n",
    "- **Seaborn**: For enhanced boxplots to visualize spread and outliers in customer behaviour metrics.\n",
    "- **Plotly**: For interactive scatter plots or bar charts to explore relationships between customer segments and purchase behaviour dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "These charts will provide both static and interactive views of customer behaviour, helping to identify key insights effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Customer Segmentation\n",
    "- Group customers by their RFM scores for targeted marketing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach combines statistical summaries with effective visual tools to gain a comprehensive understanding of customer behaviour.\n"

    "## Importing Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin our customer behaviour analysis, we need to import the essential Python libraries that will help us load, process, and visualize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis (e.g., reading data, grouping, summarizing).\n",
    "- **numpy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.\n",
    "- **datetime**: For working with dates, which is important when calculating recency.\n",
    "- **matplotlib.pyplot**: A core Python library for creating static visualizations like histograms and bar charts.\n",
    "- **seaborn**: A higher-level visualization library built on top of matplotlib, useful for more aesthetic charts like boxplots and distribution plots.\n",
    "- **plotly.express**: For interactive and dynamic visualizations like scatter plots and bar charts that allow user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Display Settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `%matplotlib inline`: Ensures that Matplotlib charts appear directly within the notebook cells.\n",
    "- `plt.style.use('ggplot')`: Applies a clean and visually appealing style to Matplotlib plots.\n",
    "- `sns.set(style='whitegrid')`: Sets the background style of Seaborn plots to show light gridlines for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "These libraries will provide the tools we need to perform data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visual storytelling throughout this notebook.\n"
