# üì¶ Online Retail Analysis

This project is a basic, beginner-friendly data analytics project that presents a ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and data analysis pipeline using an online retail transaction dataset. Designed to be accessible for those new to data analysis, it explores customer behavior, product popularity, and sales trends to generate simple yet meaningful insights for improving marketing, inventory management, and pricing strategies.

## üìÇ Dataset Content

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains historical transaction data from a UK-based online retail store.

### Key columns:

InvoiceNo: Unique transaction code

StockCode: Product identifier

Description: Product name

Quantity: Number of units sold

InvoiceDate: Date of transaction

UnitPrice: Price per unit

CustomerID: Identifier for each customer

Country: Customer location

## üíº Business Requirements

Understand customer engagement and segmentation.

Identify top-selling products to optimize inventory and marketing.

Analyze sales patterns over time to support forecasting.

## ‚ùì Hypotheses and How to Validate

Hypothesis Validation Approach

High-spending customers shop more frequently Use RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

Certain products consistently sell more Group by ProductName and rank by total quantity

Sales show monthly seasonality Aggregate sales by Month and plot trends

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Plan

### ETL Pipeline

Import libraries

Data extraction & cleaning

Feature engineering

### Customer Behavior Analysis

RFM metrics

Top spender analysis

### Product Analysis

Popular product identification

Top 10 products visualization

### Sales Trend Analysis

Time-based sales aggregation

## Mapping Business Requirements to Visualizations

Requirement Visualization

Identify loyal customers Bar chart of top 10 customers by spending

Spot high-demand products Seaborn bar chart of top-selling products

Detect seasonality Line chart (monthly/daily sales) using Matplotlib & Plotly

## üìä Analysis Techniques Used

RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

Descriptive Statistics (Total sales, avg. transaction value)

Grouping & Aggregation (e.g., by month, customer, product)

## Data Visualizations using:

Matplotlib for static charts

Seaborn for polished visuals

Plotly for interactive charts

## Fixed Issues

### Issue 1: InvoiceDate Becomes object When Reloaded

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Type & Import Handling

During the ETL process, InvoiceDate was correctly converted to datetime.

However, when saved to CSV and reloaded in another notebook, it appeared as object (string).

This occurred because CSV files store dates as plain text.

‚úÖ Solution

Use the parse_dates parameter when reading the CSV:

df = pd.read_csv('cleaned_data.csv', parse_dates=['InvoiceDate'])

### Issue 2: DtypeWarning Due to Mixed Types in InvoiceNo

Warning:

DtypeWarning: Columns (0) have mixed types. Specify dtype option on import or set low_memory=False.
The InvoiceNo column contains mixed types (likely due to string prefixes like 'C' for cancellations).

‚úÖ Solution
Convert InvoiceNo to numeric:

df['Invoice'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Invoice'], errors='coerce').astype('Int64')
Ensure InvoiceDate is also properly parsed:

df['InvoiceDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['InvoiceDate'])

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations

Data Integrity: Only valid transactions (non-cancelled, non-zero quantities) are included.

## üêû Unfixed Bugs

Hover info in Plotly charts occasionally overlaps on smaller screens.

Product naming inconsistencies may still exist due to free-text entries.

Country and Weekday columns remain in object dtype.

Attempts to convert Country and Weekday to the string dtype were unsuccessful due to pandas/environment constraints.

These columns currently remain as object dtype and may be updated in future releases for optimized string handling.

## üöß Development Roadmap

Build ETL pipeline

Conduct RFM analysis

Explore sales trends

Deploy dashboard (e.g., Tableau)

Automate ETL workflow with scheduling (e.g., Airflow)

Convert object columns (Country, Weekday) to pandas string dtype when environment supports it

Implement interactive visualization to identify high-value, low-frequency customers using Plotly or similar tool
